Pandas is a very powerful toolkit for data analysis and manipulation. If you've never heard of it and you work with Excel, I recommend you take some minutes to read about it:  

[Introduction to Pandas](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-introduction-to-the-pandas-python-library-f1b678f34673)

As for visualization, there are many options but for now I'll be working with Matplot and Seaborn.

## My Pandas projects

1) Data manipulation exercises using 4 datasets. Charts plotted with Matplot and Seaborn.

2) Data manipulation and analysis using IMDb datasets and Pandas. Matplot and Seaborn were used to plot the charts.
